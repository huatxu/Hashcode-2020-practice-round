# Google Hashcode 2020 - Practice round problem

This is my solution to the **More Pizza** problem. It is an iterative solution that performs well enough. 


## Usage

The current implementation reads all the ".in" files in the current execution path and outputs its solutions on a ".out" file named after its input.

### Comments

I used several Java 8 Stream operations to keep the code compact and understandable although the verbosity of Java.

## Results
